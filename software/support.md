# Software Support

NLeSC provides very limited support for software. During a project we make every effort to create low-maintenance code by building on as many standard components as possible, using software from eStep, and putting a lot of effort into documenting and testing software. Also, by using standard file formats and API's we try to limit the effort required to maintain software, and make it easier to continue development.

After a project has finished NLeSC in principle will not further support software. Reported bugs in our own software will of course have a high chance of being looked at, but this also has its limits. We cannot in any way contribute to the administration of infrastructure needed after a project has ended.

Because of the lack of support after projects is is a good idea to start to think about and make agreements on where software will land and who will maintain infrastructure at the very beginning of a project. The project proposal should already contain a plan.

For in-house developed eStep software we _do_ provide some support, though even here only limited time is available for this. See the technology page on the website (https://www.esciencecenter.nl/technology) for the list of supported software.
