# Communication

Communication to the outside world is important for visibility of NLeSC projects and for building
the user base.

Communication to other developers is a way to build community and contributors. It also increases
NLeSC visibility in development world.

## Home page

with all the necessary introduction information, links to documentation, source code (github) and latest release download (e.g. [github.io pages](https://pages.github.com/))

The page should be created at the latest when the software is ready to be seen by the outside world. It is the place where people will learn about software, so it is important to describe its goals and functionality.
It should be targeted towards non-programming users (unless software is meant for programers i.e library) but should have
pointers for developers to more advanced resources (README.md)

## Project discussion list

Github issues, mailing list, not private email, for all project related
discussions from the beginning of the project

There should be no private discussions about the project. Therefore once discussions are started
(in the email), either move them to github issues or if they donâ€™t fit into issues format any more,
create the mailing list.

## Demo docker image in dockerhub (with Dockerfile)

When applies, ususally for services.

If software is the service Docker image should be created at the very early stage. This will allow for easier testing and platform
independent use.

## An online demo

For websites

Online demo should be available since first stable release.
When the website is the user interface for researchers, make sure there is a development version
running somewhere so that they can *play around with it* and give usability feedback.

## Pitch presentation (1 to 3 slides)

Pitch presentation should be prepared when visible results of the software are available.
It is important to keep those up to date and that other engineers have easy access to it.

## Few sentences summary of the project

For [nlesc technology pages](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/technology)

Short description of the project should be provided from the beginning of the project.
Starting with requirements and should be updated along the way.
