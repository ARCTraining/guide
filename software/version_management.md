# Code Hosting and Version Management

To keep our code transparent and findable the preferred code hosting platform is Github and version management or scm is git. The repo preferable should be public from the start.

On Github there is a NLeSC organization at https://github.com/NLeSC which contains cross-project repositories.
Projects host their repo inside the NLeSC organization or in it's own project organization.

To allow non-NLeSC employees to push changes to NLeSC repositories they can be added as outside collaborators.

You can get a free GitHub Micro Plan (5 private repo's) on your own account if you ask nicely. Very usefull when writing papers and such.
