This Knowledge Base is by and for the eScience Research Engineers at NLeSC.

## Scope

To make sure the information in this knowledge base stays relevant and  up to date it is intentionally low on technical details.

#### Example: Good

At NLeSC we prefer Java and Python over C++ and Perl, as these languages in general produce more sustainable code.

#### Example: Bad

At NLeSC we use Oracle Java 1.6 which you can download here (www.oracle.com/java1.6.5). We use Log4j 1.4 (www.log4j.org).
