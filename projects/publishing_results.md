#Publishing Scientific Results

## Handling datasets and results
Assuming you have only the software in a (private) git repo, you might want to also add and share with others the data and results related to that software:
* Add also the data and figures using git lfs ([Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)). 
* If not, make the repo public. 

## Citing datasets, software and results
* Make a [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) account and link it with your github account.
* Make a release in github.
* Zenodo automatically tracks the release and generates a unique DOI.
* Use the DOI for citing your software/data/results.
