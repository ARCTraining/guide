# Data handling


#### preparing data for analysis
Usually the data you get is not in the format that is easy to process in R. It's called *messy* data. It has to be converted into *tidy* format. There are two packages that make it easy to tidy your messy data. It's [tidyr](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr) and [reshape2](https://github.com/hadley/reshape).

The idea of tidy and messy data is explained in a [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) paper by Hadley Wickham.

There is also [manipulatr](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/manipulatr) group used to discuss topics related to data manipulation in R.
