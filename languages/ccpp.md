# C and C++

C++ may be the most complicated programming language in existence. It supports a variety of programming styles,
including imperative, object oriented, functional, and generic programming. It lets you create very high-level
abstractions, but it also gives you low-level primitives and direct control over memory. Its powerful type system
can check for many errors at compile time, making your software safer, but it can also be ignored or overridden,
resulting in dangerous code. Because of its versatility, C++ leaves you free to design your code in any way you want,
but that also means that it does not guide you in any way.

In short, C++ is a very sharp tool. It can be used to create beautiful masterpieces (and ugly-but-extremely-fast work
horses), but it takes a long time to master, and while learning you're likely to cut yourself more than once. At the
eScience Center, we work together with scientists and engineers with a wide variety of programming skills, including
expert software engineers, but also domain scientists with only basic knowledge of programming. **For most projects
and new code, we therefore recommend simpler languages like Python or Java**. However, if we need to make extensions
to a program written in C++, then it usually makes sense to write those extensions also in C++. When that happens, we
will use C++ best practices to do so.
