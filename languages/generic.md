# Generic and Multi-language tools and libraries

**Most of the info in this section should perhaps be in the previous chapter**

## Git:

To keep our code transparent and findable the preferred code hosting platform is Github and version management or scm is git.

* Github help: http://help.github.com
* Git homepage: http://git-scm.com/
* Pro Git Online Book: http://git-scm.com/book
* Reference: http://gitref.org/index.html
* In depth book: [Version Control with Git](http://www.amazon.com/Version-Control-Git-collaborative-development/dp/1449316387/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347950111&sr=8-1&keywords=git)

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create webpages, wikis and user documentation with a minimum of effort. Documentation written in markdown looks exactly like a plain-text document and is perfectly human-readable. In addition, it can also be automatically converted to HTML, latex, pdf, etc.
More information about markdown can be found here:

<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>

Retext is a markdown aware text editor, that can be used to edit markdown files and convert them into HTML or PDF. It can be found at:

<http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/>

Alternatively, 'pandoc' is a command line utility that can convert markdown documents to into several other formats (including latex):

An Eclipse plugin for previewing the HTML generated by markdown is available on this page:

## editor configuration
Use [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to adhere to the basic code style
rules.

[download](https://github.com/NLeSC/knowledge/tree/master/software/config) nlesc editor config file.

**editorconfig**  supports most of the editors. [Here](http://editorconfig.org/)
you can download plugins for your editor of choice.

If you use eclipse, use [this plugin](https://github.com/ncjones/editorconfig-eclipse).

## Continuous Integration

To run testing, perform code quality analysis and build artifacts a Continuous Integration server can be used. The build will be performed every git push and pull request. Using a CI server will help with `it works for me` problems.
NLeSC uses continuous integration services as much as possible when creating code.

### Travis-CI

The NLeSC public repositories should be build with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org). Travis-CI is free for Open Source projects. A repo can be added from Github to Travis-CI by a Github administrator.

[Getting started with Travis CI](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/)

PS. If you want to get mails from Travis-CI then you have to login at https://travis-ci.org

### Jenkins-CI

At the NLeSC we run a [Jenkins-CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/) instance which is behind a login at https://ci.esciencecenter.nl .
It is used mostly for private repositories.

Features of jobs:
- compile project.
- runs tests.
- generates documentation.
- triggers by GitHub commit.
- notifications to commit author when unstable.
- when applicable launches a SonarQube analysis, which can be viewed at https://sonar.esciencecenter.nl .

## Software quality improvement tools

There are several web services that analyze code. The analyze code when triggered by a git push and can ingest code coverage generated on a Continuous-Integration server. They are free for open source projects. We also run our own SonarQube instance.

### SonarQube

SonarQube (http://www.sonarqube.org/) is an open platform to manage code quality.
On our Jenkins build server we do a SonarQube analysis for each Jenkins job. Out SonarQube instance is hosted at https://sonar.esciencecenter.nl and is behind a login.
Sonar Qube can analyze Java, Python and Javascript.

### [Code climate](https://codeclimate.com)
Can analyze Javascript (and Ruby, PHP).
For example project see https://codeclimate.com/github/NLeSC/PattyVis

### [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com)
Can analyze Java, Python and Javascript (and CSS, PHP, Scala).
The analysis for Java and Python is not as good as for Javascript.
The analysis is quite slow, as it analyzes each past commit.
For example project see https://www.codacy.com/public/sverhoeven/PattyVis/dashboard

### [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/)
Can analyze Python (and PHP, Ruby).
For example project see https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/NLeSC/eEcology-Annotation-WS/

### [Landscape](https://landscape.io)
Can analyze Python. It is missing code coverage.
For example project see https://landscape.io/github/NLeSC/MAGMa

### [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)
Can show code coverages over time for many languages including Java, Python and Javascript.
For example project see https://coveralls.io/r/NLeSC/MAGMa

### [Codecov](https://codecov.io)
Can show code coverages for many languages including Java, Python and Javascript.
Shows unified coverage and separate coverage for matrix builds.
For example project see https://codecov.io/github/NLeSC/Xenon
