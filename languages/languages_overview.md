This chapter provides practical info on each of the main programming languages of NLeSC.

This info is (on purpose) high level, try to provide "default" options, and mostly link to more info.

Each chapter should contain:

- Intro: philosophy, typical usecases.
- Recommended sources of information
- Installing compilers and runtimes
- Editors and IDEs
- Coding style conventions
- Building and packaging code
- Testing
- Code quality analysis tools and services
- Debugging and Profiling
- Logging
- Writing documentation
- Recommended additional packages and libraries
- Available templates


## Preferred Languages

At NLeSC we prefer Java and Python over C++ and Perl, as these languages in general produce more sustainable code. It is not always possible to choose which libraries we use, as almost all projects have existing code as a starting point.

(In alphabetical order)

- Java
- JavaScript (preferably Typescript)
- Python
- OpenCL and CUDA
- R
