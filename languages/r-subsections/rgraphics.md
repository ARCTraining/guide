# Graphics

#### plotting
The basic R installation comes with a wide range of functions to visualise data: adding legends, subplots, text, double axes, and much more. If you need to quickly inspect your data or create an elegant custom-made 2D plot for a scientific paper then these basic functions are likely to do the job.

However, R also comes with plotting packages. Probably the most popular and powerfull graphics package is [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org). Interactive plots can be made with [ggvis](https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis) package and embeded in web application.

#### building interactive web applications
Thanks to [shiny.app](http://shiny.rstudio.com) it is possible to make interactive web application in R without the need to write javascript or html.
