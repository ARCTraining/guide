#### plotting
For an impression of what R can do see: http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/all-graphs/

The basic R installation comes with a wide range of functions to visualise data. If you need to quickly inspect your data or create an elegant custom-made plot then these basic functions are likely to do the job.

However, R also comes with contributed plotting packages that claim to offer easier syntax or convenient templates for creating specialised plots. Probably the most popular and powerfull contributed graphics package is [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org). Interactive plots can be made with [ggvis](https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis) package and embeded in web application.

#### building interactive web applications
Thanks to [shiny.app](http://shiny.rstudio.com) it is possible to make interactive web application in R without the need to write javascript or html.

#### building reports
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is R package designed to build dynamic reports in R. It's possible to generete on the fly new pdf or html documents with results of computations embedded inside.
