# Getting started

### Seting up R
To install R check detailed description at [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org).

#### IDE
R programs can be writen in any editor. R code can be run from the command line or interactively within R environment, that can be started with `R` command in the shell. To quit R environment type `q()`.

[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) is a free powerfull integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It features editor with code completion, command line environment, file manager, package manager and history lookup among others. You will have to install RStudio in addition to installing R. Please note that updating RStudio does not update R and the other way around.

Within RStudio you can work on ad-hoc code or create a project. Compared with Python an R project is a bit like a virtual environment as it preserves the workspace and installed packages for that project. Creating a project is needed to build an R package. A project is created via the menu at the top of the screen.

### Installing compilers and runtimes
See overview by Hadley Wickham [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/src.html). Not needed as most functions in R are already compile in C, nevertheless R has compiling functionality see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/compiler/html/compile.html).
