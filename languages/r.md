## What is R?
[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

One of the strengths of R is the large number of available open source statistical packages. They can be found on [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org). R is particularly popular in the more social, health, biological sciences.

#### Compared with other languages / tools

R versus Matlab, Stata, SAS and SPSS:
* R is open source and covers most or even more of the functionalities that these commercial tools have to offer

R versus Python:
* R does not need notebooks to program interactively. RStudio provides an interactive programming interface where the user can inspect variable values, debug, and run sections of the code (select section and then Ctrl+Enter). Consequently R also does not have the problems with merging notebooks on github.
* Indexing of object dimensions is intuitive for the domain scientists: values 2, 3 and 4 of an object are selected as 2:4
* Just like in Python the speed of R code is dependent on how well you are able to avoid using loops. R is based on C and it is possible to speed up your R code by writing aspects in C. R can work with Spark and MapReduce, and also comes with parallel processing packages likes parallel and foreach.
* There is no need for a discussion about what R version to use, just download the most recent version.
