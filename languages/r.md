[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

One of the strengths of R is the large number of available open source statistical packages. They can be found on [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org).

#### Advantages compared with other languages

Statistical package:
* Open source compared with statistical software packages like Stata, SAS and SPSS

R versus Python:
* R does not need notebooks to program interactively. RStudio provides an interactive programming interface where the user can quickly inspect variable values or run sections of the code (select section and then Ctrl+Enter). Consequently R also does not have the problems with merging notebooks on github.
* Indexing of object dimensions is intuitive for the domain scientists:  value 2, 3 and 4 of an object are selected as 2:4
* The speed of R code is dependent on well you are able to avoid using loops. R is based on C and it is possible to speed up your R code by writing aspects in C. R can work with Spark and MapReduce, and also comes with some parallel processing tools like packages: parallel and foreach.
* R syntax is backward compatible, so need for a discussion about what version to use, just download the most recent version.
* For every package contributed R comes with detailed compulsory function documentation.
