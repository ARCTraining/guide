## What is R?
R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics, for more information see: https://www.r-project.org/.

### Phylosophy and typical usecases
R is particularly popular in the social, health, and biological sciences where it is used for statistical modeling. R can also be used for signal processing (e.g. FFT), image analyses, and neuro-linguistic programming. The R syntax is similar in compactness and readability as python and matlab by which it serves as a good prototyping environment.

One of the strengths of R is the large number of available open source statistical packages of developed by domain experts. For example, R-package [Seewave](http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/) is specialised in sound analyses. Packages are typically released on CRAN [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org).

Some comparisons with Python:
* Just like in Python the speed of R code is dependent on how well you are able to avoid using loops. R is based on C and it is possible to speed up your R code by writing aspects in C. R can work with Spark and MapReduce, and also comes with parallel processing packages likes parallel and foreach.
* Compared with Python, R does not need notebooks to program interactively. In RStudio the user can inspect variable values, debug, and run sections of the code (select section and then Ctrl+Enter). Consequently R also does not have the problems with merging notebooks on github.
* Indexing of object dimensions is intuitive for the domain scientists: element 2, 3 and 4 of an object can be selected as 2:4
* There is no need for a discussion about what R version to use, just download the most recent version.

#### Editors and IDEs
RStudio is the best EDI for R. You will have to install this in addition to installing R. See [paragraph](./r-subsections/rgettingstarted.md) on getting started with R.
