[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

One of the strengths of R is the large number of available open source statistical packages. They can be found on [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org).

#### Advantages compared with other tools

* Open source compared with statistical software packages like Stata, SAS and SPSS
1. No need for notebooks like in Python, RStudio provides an interactive programming interface where you can quickly inspect variable values and run sections of the code (select section and then Ctrl+Enter). Consequently R also does not have the problems with merging notebooks.
* Indexing of object dimensions is straightforward, column 2 till 4 is specified by 2:4.
* As R project in RStudio have their own package environment, there is no need to create, start and stop a virtual environment for every project every time you work on it, like in Python.
* R is based on C by which speed of code is heavily dependent on how well you master R. There are plenty of tricks in R to avoid programming looks.
* R syntax is backward well compatible. So, no Pythonic discussion about what version to use, just download the most recent version.
* R comes with detailed compulsory function documentation for every package contributed
