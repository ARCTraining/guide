[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

One of the strengths of R is the large number of available open source statistical packages. They can be found on [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org).

#### Advantages compared with other languages

Statistical package:
* Open source compared with statistical software packages like Stata, SAS and SPSS

R versus Python:
* R does not need notebooks to program interactively. RStudio provides an interactive programming interface where the user can quickly inspect variable values or run sections of the code (select section and then Ctrl+Enter). Consequently R also does not have the problems with merging notebooks on github.
* Indexing of object dimensions is intuitive for the domain scientists:  value 2, 3 and 4 of an object are selected as 2:4
* R is based on C by which speed of code is heavily dependent on how well you master R. There are plenty of tricks in R to avoid programming looks.
* R syntax is backward well compatible. So, no Pythonic discussion about what version to use, just download the most recent version.
* R comes with detailed compulsory function documentation for every package contributed
