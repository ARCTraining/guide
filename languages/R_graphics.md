# Graphics
#### plotting
R cames with multiple plotting packages. Probably the most popular and powerfull graphics package is [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org).

Interactive plots can be made with [ggvis](https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis) package and embeded in web application.

#### building interactive web applications
Thanks to [shiny.app](http://shiny.rstudio.com) it is possible to make interactive web application in R without the need to write javascript or html.
